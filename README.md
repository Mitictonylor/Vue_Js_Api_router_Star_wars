# Brief

You have been asked to build an app to display information about Star Wars films.

**MVP**

- The app should initially display a list of the film titles
- When a film title is clicked the app should load the film details including title, episode number, release date and director
- When the film detail loads, the films characters details (name and height) should also be displayed

**Extensions**

- Add a filter to format the height from centimetres into meters
- Add a filter to format the date as dd MMM YYYY. (19 May 1999)
- Also show details of a characters home world (name, terrain) along with the character name and height

**Advanced Extensions**

- Use router to add a link to the film details. When this is clicked it should take you to a view that displays the films opening crawl text. The crawl view should take in the film as a prop to access the crawl.


# ToDO

- get more css into it
